what is middle wear function?
ANS: In Node.js, especially within the context of the Express framework, middleware functions
     are functions that intercept and process requests and responses, enabling tasks like logging, authentication,
     and data validation before the request reaches the final route handler. 


syntax:

example:

const middle=(req,res,next)=>{
    req.body.name="middlewear"
    console.log(req.body);
    next();
}
 
 app.get("/adddata",middle,(req,res)=>{
